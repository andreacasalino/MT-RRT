The paper presents a framework for multithreaded RRT-based
motion planning introducing four different parallelization
strategies. Results comparing the time efficiency of these
strategies for different planning problems are presented.

The authors address a relevant but also well-studied
problem. Most reviewers generally appreciate the presented
framework but also point out several issues that need to be
resolved prior to publication. 

The literature review needs to be complemented with related
work on parallelization schemes as pointed out in the
reviews.

The clarity of presentation in the algorithms and the
experimental section needs to be be improved. To avoid
confusion, the established CS term 'critical section'
should be used instead of 'critical region'. Superlinear
speedups in Fig.7 and 8 should be discussed. See reviewers'
comments for further details.
