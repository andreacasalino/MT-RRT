Comments to the author
======================

This paper addresses multithreading strategies for RRT,
bidirectional RRT or RRT*. In detail, it presents the
efficiency of parallelization (normalized speed up) for
four cases with four multithreading strategies. The
multithreading strategies consist of 1) querying
activities, 2) a shared tree, 3) copied trees and 4)
blinded multiagents explorations. Its result is that the
multithreading strategy with blinded multiagents
explorations is most efficient.

Comments
1)	In the bidirectional version, expansions are made
in forward and backward trees. So, it seems that Eq. (2) is
the same as Eq. (1).
2)	In parallel exploration on a shared tree, authors
use the term, critical region, which is not clearly
defined. It seems like the critical region is shown as the
relation, || xs – xf || <= Threshold in Algorithm 4.
3)	In the results, authors present methods for the
simulations to compare the efficiency of multithreading
strategies. In Fig. 5, 6, 7 and 8, it seems like the bars
in those graphs represent the standard deviation. So,
authors should indicate the meaning of the bars. If they
indicate the standard deviation, authors should present how
many simulations are made with 2500 iterations.
4)	It is more desirable that authors additionally
present a mean computation time (including a standard
deviation) required to get a solution for each strategy.
