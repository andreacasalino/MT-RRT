Comments to the author
======================

In this paper, authors presented a parallel mechanism for
RRT-based algorithms, such as RRT, Bi-RRT, RRT*. By
parallel searching, the computation load is separately
distributed and the total computation time is effectively
reduced. Detailed comments are listed as follows..

1. In section II.A, the computational time analysis is
decided by two main factors, i.e., optimal trajectory
connecting two states and required collision checks.
According to eq(1), the obstacles avoiding checks is $O(I
t_V)$. But in the connecting process, intermediate states
along $\tau$ also require to be checked whether admissible
in configuration space $X$. Authors are suggested to
describe this part more clearly.

2. Why two same procedures "threads barrier" are called in
line 13-14 of Alg.5. It seems an editing error.

3. The description of Alg.4-Alg.6 is poor. For the purpose
of reading this paper, the key procedures in each
algorithms are supposed to be described clearly. 

4. In section III-B and III-C, critical regions are
designed to achieve the parallel searching. Authors are
supposed to present the detailed settings of critical
regions.
