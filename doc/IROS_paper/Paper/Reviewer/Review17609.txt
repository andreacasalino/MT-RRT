Comments to the author
======================

The pseudo code is somewhat hard to follow. In Algorithm 1,
Steer is not defined.

The example figures are also hard to interpret. The red
jagged line in Figures 3 and 4 looks like a path but I
think it is the robot.

In the caption to Figure 3 there seems to be text missing.
"On the left the poses xo and xf, while..." is not a
complete phrase and some text needs to be added.  Also it
is impossible to see where xo and xf are.

Problems like this have been pursued for decades. They are
all members of the class of shortest path algorithms. As a
user of such algorithms for robot task planning over 50
years ago it is amazing to me to see the challenges still
remaining and the similarities to methods we used (forward
and backward chaining, for example) still being explored. I
used the Hart, Nilsson, Raphael A* algorithm.
