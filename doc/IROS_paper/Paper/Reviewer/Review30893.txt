Comments to the author
======================

This work describes a multithreading implementation to
speed up RRTs. I have 2 major comments:
1)	The references section is not complete. A better
coverage of RRTs should be carried out.
2)	As this is an experimental work, a thorough
analysis of performance of the 4 strategies is required. A
table showing the performance of the multithreaded
strategies in terms of computational time as well as
computational space. The results should be compared with
the original RRT and fast implementations of RRT such as
RRG, RRT*, and LBT-RRT.
